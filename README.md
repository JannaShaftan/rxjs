How does Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) compare to Golang Channels (CSP) ?

I took the examples from  the rxjs repository (https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rxjs-jquery/tree/master/examples) and 
ported them to Go. 

Have a look at the examples (written in Golang using https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) and let me know !
